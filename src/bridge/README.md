# Bridge Module

Platform-specific protocol bridges between game wire protocols and the
[mjai JSONL protocol](https://gimite.net/pukiwiki/index.php?Mjai%20%E9%BA%BB%E9%9B%80AI%E5%AF%BE%E6%88%A6%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%90)
consumed by AI bots.

## Trait

```rust
pub trait Bridge: Send {
    fn parse(&mut self, direction: Direction, content: &[u8]) -> ParseResult;
    fn build(&mut self, command: &MjaiEvent) -> Option<Vec<u8>>;
}
```

- `parse` — raw WS binary frame → zero or more `MjaiEvent`s plus the
  bridge's first-pass structured view of the frame (`ParseResult`), which
  the inspector timeline records.
- `build` — outbound mjai command (also `MjaiEvent`) → optional raw WS binary frame (autoplay).

## mjai types

`MjaiEvent` lives in [`crate::schema::mjai`](../schema/mjai/mod.rs) — it's used
across the project (bridge output, AI bots, frontend HUD) and isn't owned by
this module. See `src/schema/README.md`.

One bridge instance per independent game session. For Majsoul that means one
per WebSocket flow, since each flow has its own request id sequence and game
state.

## Selecting a bridge

`bridge::for_platform(platform, flow_log, session, hooks)` returns a
`Box<dyn Bridge>` for the configured [`Platform`](../config/platform.rs). The
proxy handler builds a fresh bridge inside `handle_websocket` so per-flow state
is isolated.

## `BridgeHooks`

Shared slots the autoplay layer hands to a bridge. Every field is optional and
platform-specific; each capture path wires the subset its platform needs (the
MITM path wires Riichi City's injection gate, the chromium path the rest).
They exist because autoplay needs facts only the protocol parser sees:

| Field | Platform | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| `time_budget` | Majsoul | The server's per-decision-window time grant (`OptionalOperationList.time_fixed/time_add`). |
| `input_watch` | Majsoul | A counter of the client's own uplink input commands, so a click can be told from one the UI swallowed. |
| `tenhou_state` | Tenhou | The hand at Tenhou tile-index resolution plus the current decision window — what makes a client frame encodable. |
| `riichi_inject` | Riichi City | The frame-injection gate: in-game flag, decision window, injected-frame relay. |
| `notify` | Tenhou | Toast channel for states no mjai event can carry (a mid-hand rejoin). |

Bundled into one struct so adding a platform's slot doesn't grow the argument
list of every constructor between here and the capture backend.

## Adding a new platform

1. Add a variant to `config::Platform` (`src/config/platform.rs`).
2. Create `src/bridge/<name>/mod.rs` with a struct that implements `Bridge`.
3. Re-export it from `src/bridge/mod.rs` and add the match arm in
   `for_platform`.
4. If the platform will support autoplay and its planner needs something only
   the parser sees, add a field to `BridgeHooks` rather than a new parameter.

## Existing bridges

- `majsoul/` — Majsoul (lq.* protobuf over WS). `parser.rs` decodes raw
  WS frames into `ParsedMessage { msg_type, msg_id, method_name, payload }`;
  `mod.rs` runs the state machine that turns them into mjai events. See
  `majsoul/parser.rs` module docs for the 5-layer wire format. Protocol
  layout follows the published Majsoul `liqi.proto` schema; no third-party
  source code is copied.
- `tenhou/` — Tenhou (plain JSON over WS). Parses server frames into mjai, and
  implements `build` in the other direction — not on the autoplay path, which
  drives the client's own input instead. See `tenhou/README.md`.
- `riichi_city/` — Riichi City (JSON inside a 15-byte binary header).
  Autoplay is supported by injecting client frames over the MITM proxy.
  See `riichi_city/README.md`.
